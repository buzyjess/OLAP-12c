Oracle 12 C OLAP sample Schema examples
Install OLAP 11g schema example in 12c.

This page has got the Oracle schema which has been modified to suite the oracle 12C PDB DB creation. With Oracle 12c, Oracle introduced the concept of Multi-tenant DB's . It introduced the concept of Container DB's and Pluggable DB's. Container DB is the parent DB as I would call it and to it the users add/pluggable DBs. The pluggable DB's are low resource intensive DB's . More about Pluggable DB's and their installation is in the below.

The important concept or differences that I identified working with are

Container DB
Pluggable DB
Concept of Session inside a Container
Global users and pluggable users .
Overview of the Multitenant Architecture

Concepts for Database Administrators
